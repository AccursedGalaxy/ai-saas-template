## Overview

This repository streamlines development by including:

- **Replit Integration:** Configuration files (.replit and replit.nix) are provided so you can edit and run the project directly in Replit.
- **Python Environment:** Managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), featuring FastAPI, Uvicorn, and preconfigured linting, testing, and formatting tools.
- **Go Environment:** Organized with a modular layout using Go modules, and includes essential libraries for building scalable applications (for example, the Gin framework and Firebase integration).
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflows support both Python and Go environments.
- **Extensibility & Documentation:** Guidance for extending the template for additional features and a starting point for writing your own project documentation.

## Key Features

- **Minimal Setup:** Clone and begin coding immediately with preconfigured development environments.
- **Preconfigured Tools:** Automated linting, testing, and dependency management with Poetry (Python) and Go modules.
- **Replit Ready:** Open and run directly on Replit with the provided configuration files.
- **Scalable & Modular:** Easily extend the template to support additional services, features, or even new languages.
- **Documentation Template:** Use this README file as a starting point to document your own project comprehensively.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to configure your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   To clone the repository, execute the following command in your terminal:
   
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-saas-template.git
       cd ai-saas-template

2. **Python Setup**  
   To set up the Python environment:
   
       cd python
       poetry install
       poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

3. **Go Setup**  
   To run the Go application, open a new terminal and execute:
   
       cd go
       go run cmd/main.go

4. **Using Replit**  
   This project is preconfigured for Replit. When you open it in Replit, the .replit and replit.nix files automatically set up the environment.

## Usage Guide

A unified run script is available for switching between services. From the project root, run:

       bash ./scripts/run.sh python

To run the Go service, replace "python" with "go":

       bash ./scripts/run.sh go

## Writing Your Own Documentation

This repository doubles as a template for creating high-quality project documentation. Here are some best practices:

- **Clear Structure:** Organize your docs with headings/subheadings such as Overview, Setup, Usage, API Reference, etc.
- **Embed Code Examples:** Instead of nested code blocks, use indentation. For example, to document an API call in Python:

       import requests
       response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
       print(response.json())

- **Link to External Resources:** Reference related projects, tutorials, or documentation for tools (e.g., Poetry, FastAPI).
- **Maintain Consistency:** Follow a style guide to keep your documentation consistent and readable.
- **Keep It Updated:** Ensure your documentation evolves with your project.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! To help improve this template:

- **Fork the Repository:** Create a development branch to work on new features or bug fixes.
- **Follow the Style:** Keep your code and documentation consistent with the existing template.
- **Submit a Pull Request:** Provide a clear explanation of your changes along with relevant examples.

We hope this template helps you jump into development with minimal setup so that you can focus on building great AI-powered SaaS products. Happy coding!
